/*
 * << HOW TO ADD BLOG POSTS >>
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Read all of the instructions before making ANY changes!!
 * 
 * The const below contains a list of javascript objects. Each object represents a blog post,
 * and contains the following properties:
 * "title" - The title of the blog post.
 * "date" - The date the blog post was posted (so today if you are adding one).
 * "body" - The actual text content of the blog post.
 * "link" - Most of these blog posts just link to articles on other sites, so this is the link.
 * 
 * The blog posts are displayed in the order they are listed in the const. You can re-order them
 * if you'd like.
 * 
 * Copy and past the below template into the posts list to get started if you are adding a 
 * new blog post, then fill out its properties. 
 * 
 * TEMPLATE:

    "title": "TITLE_HERE",
